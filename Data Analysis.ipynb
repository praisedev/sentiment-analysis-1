While walking around Fremont Street, she was enamored by the ziplining that was happening above us and we thought this would be a cool activity.\\n\\nIn order to purchase tickets, you have to go to the ticket area located at the entrance of Fremont near Walgreens. If you walk all the way to the end, you'll be sent back here. There should be better signage, especially if you just fought a bunch of drunk people to get to the wrong area.\\n\\nOnce you're inside, they have a bunch of kiosks where you can choose which activity you'd like to do and designated time slots that are available. Because everything was booked up on a Friday night, we opted to do the simple version which was flying halfway through Fremont in a seated position. We chose our time, paid our $25, signed a digital waiver and off we went until it was time.\\n\\nWhen it was our turn, we walked up a set of stairs thinking it was gonna be a breeze. We were wrong. Once you get upstairs, you're weighed and then pointed to another line. They only let a set amount of people up the elevators at once, so it can take a while. Our time was 1140PM and we didn't actually get to the actual zipline until 1230AM. You don't see the queue from the street, so it can be a little deceptive. Just give yourself that extra breathing room, especially if you have other people waiting around for you.\\n\\nOne thing I really liked was that they gave you some heavy duty bags with zippers to put your belongings in. That way you're not losing them 100+ feet up in the air. I thought that was super convenient and well thought out.\\n\\nThe ride itself was fun and my niece had a blast. They take a few pictures during the experience that are available for purchase afterwards in case you wanted to commemorate the occasion. The staff were all very nice and friendly and I would recommend this activity for anyone looking for something to do for a few hours to kill time while in old Vegas.</td>\n",

The beer is put into a cup with a magnet underneath that you can keep as a souvenir. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty much the same as back home so I hope they incorporate some secret menu items for this location if they don't already. We will def be back!   \n",

Rose was so understanding and professional. She eased all my worries after needing a deep clean on our house after a renovation. The house was cleaned to perfection. Everything sparkled! We will definitely be using this company more frequently! Thank you for all your hard work on our house!   \n",
       "2354840  We were looking for things to do in Las Vegas with my niece since she's only 12 and gambling, drinking and other debauchery weren't on the agenda this time around. While walking around Fremont Street, she was enamored by the ziplining that was happening above us and we thought this would be a cool activity.\\n\\nIn order to purchase tickets, you have to go to the ticket area located at the entrance of Fremont near Walgreens. If you walk all the way to the end, you'll be sent back here. There should be better signage, especially if you just fought a bunch of drunk people to get to the wrong area.\\n\\nOnce you're inside, they have a bunch of kiosks where you can choose which activity you'd like to do and designated time slots that are available. Because everything was booked up on a Friday night, we opted to do the simple version which was flying halfway through Fremont in a seated position. We chose our time, paid our $25, signed a digital waiver and off we went until it was time.\\n\\nWhen it was our turn, we walked up a set of stairs thinking it was gonna be a breeze. We were wrong. Once you get upstairs, you're weighed and then pointed to another line. They only let a set amount of people up the elevators at once, so it can take a while. Our time was 1140PM and we didn't actually get to the actual zipline until 1230AM. You don't see the queue from the street, so it can be a little deceptive. Just give yourself that extra breathing room, especially if you have other people waiting around for you.\\n\\nOne thing I really liked was that they gave you some heavy duty bags with zippers to put your belongings in. That way you're not losing them 100+ feet up in the air. I thought that was super convenient and well thought out.\\n\\nThe ride itself was fun and my niece had a blast. They take a few pictures during the experience that are available for purchase afterwards in case you wanted to commemorate the occasion. The staff were all very nice and friendly and I would recommend this activity for anyone looking for something to do for a few hours to kill time while in old Vegas.   \n",
